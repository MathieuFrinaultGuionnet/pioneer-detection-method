title: "Pioneer Detection Method (PDM): Python implementation"
abstract: >
  Official Python implementation of the Pioneer Detection Method (PDM), a
  convergence-based expert-aggregation algorithm for environments with
  structural change and heterogeneous learning speeds. The method identifies
  pioneers—experts whose estimates move first in the correct direction and
  toward whom others converge—and produces dynamic weights for opinion pooling,
  forecasting under non-stationarity, and collective decision-making in
  multi-agent systems such as insurance experts, drone swarms, and autonomous
  vehicles.
